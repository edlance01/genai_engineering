    "Agents are the decision-making layer within LangChain that choose actions dynamically instead of following a fixed sequence.\n",
    "They analyze the user’s request, determine which tool is appropriate, and invoke it at the right moment.\n",
    "Agents follow a cycle of reasoning, taking action, observing the result, and adjusting their next step.\n",
    "This allows them to handle tasks that require multiple steps or real-time decision refinement.\n",
    "Agents make AI applications flexible and autonomous, enabling behaviors such as problem solving, multi-step workflows, and tool-driven interactions"
