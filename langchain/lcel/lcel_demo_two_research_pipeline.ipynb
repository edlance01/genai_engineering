    "Building a \"Research & Summarize\" pipeline in LCEL is all about using the pipe operator (|) to pass data through a series of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use RunnablePassthrough to keep our data flowing and StrOutputParser to ensure each step produces clean text for the next link in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* RunnablePassthrough.assign: This is the \"memory\" of your chain. It allows you to add new information (like the keywords or search results) to a dictionary while keeping the original user_query available for the final step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separation of Concerns: If the \"Relevance Filter\" fails, you can tweak just that prompt without breaking the \"Synthesis\" logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cost Efficiency: You’ll notice I used gpt-4o-mini for the middle steps. This saves a significant amount of money because you aren't using your most expensive model to do simple keyword extraction."

      "The latest advancements in solid-state batteries are characterized by significant improvements in energy density, safety features, and new developments in electrolyte materials. These batteries offer notably higher energy density, which translates into longer-lasting power in a smaller package, making them highly attractive for applications such as electric vehicles (EVs) and consumer electronics.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key advancement is the enhanced safety of solid-state batteries. Traditional lithium-ion batteries are prone to thermal runaway, posing risks of overheating and fires. Solid-state batteries mitigate this risk due to their robust safety features, such as non-flammable solid electrolytes, which significantly reduce the likelihood of such incidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Development of new electrolyte materials is another notable advancement, focusing on enhancing the conductivity and stability of the solid electrolytes used in these batteries. This progress contributes to the improved overall performance and efficiency of solid-state batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical specifications also highlight the voltage range and capacity improvements, alongside robust charge and discharge cycle characteristics. These improvements help increase the longevity and reliability of solid-state batteries in various applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a market level, there is a significant growth projection for the adoption of solid-state batteries, especially in the EV sector. Increasing research funding and investments are directed towards advancing solid-state technology, driven by its promising performance compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Overall, solid-state batteries present a transformative potential in energy storage solutions, driven by advancements that enhance their efficiency, safety, and applicability.\n"
