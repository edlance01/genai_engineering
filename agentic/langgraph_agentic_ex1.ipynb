    "\n",
    "\n",
    "State: This acts as the agent's working memory throughout the process. It stores inputs, outputs, and intermediate results. The state persists across node transitions, enabling complex multi-step reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges: These define the execution order and control the movement between nodes. Transitions can be direct or conditional, which determines the agent's next action and helps manage complex workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes: These are the individual processing units and the primary building blocks of agent graphs.\n",
    "State represents the agent’s working memory. It stores inputs, outputs, and intermediate results. This state is passed between nodes and updated by each one."
